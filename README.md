Forecasting sales using ARIMA Algorithm

I have applied the most commonly used method for time-series forecasting, known as ARIMA, which stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average.
ARIMA models are denoted with the notation ARIMA(p, d, q). These three parameters account for seasonality, trend, and noise in data:

The line plot will show the observed values compared to the rolling forecast predictions. Overall, forecasts align with the true values very well, showing an upward trend starting from the beginning of the year and capturing the seasonality toward the end of the year.
